I chose to code my webpage from scratch. This means that my webpage might be a little different from the webpages my peers have created. This section of the webpage is the "Code" section. You can get to other sections of the site using the tabs on the left side of the screen. When in the code section, there are some additional controls. There's an audio checkbox at the top to enable or disable audio explaining the code you view. There is also another section of tabs; these tabs represent individual functions in my code. Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoy looking through my webpage!
